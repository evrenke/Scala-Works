# Scala-Works
Various Scala assignments from my SJSU CS152 class.

Lab1 showcases a basic overview of Scala's syntax and functionality
Recursion.sc, Combinators.sc, and ListProcessing.sc showcase what their names imply,
and Knight.scala shows working with objects and case objects in Scala
final.sc covers a little bit of everything used in Scala

The most work-intensive file here is Jedi 3, which showcases the usage of parsing in Scala, 
and represents the creation of a custom language, called Jedi, using Scala
